            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Q: Why is it "brown-ish?" Why not brown?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: It sounds pretty brown, but I can't prove it, so I'm hedging.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Q: Why only brown noise?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: It's the only one I needed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Q: You should add $FEATURE! It would be so useful!</strong></p>
                    <p>A: Please feel free to add whatever you want; I didn't minify the JS and it's pretty well
                        commented, I think.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Q: I don't know how to add $FEATURE, so can you just do it?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: Of course; I'm glad to discuss my consulting rates with you any time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Q: I looked at your code and it stinks! You didn't even realize $OBVIOUS_FLAW!! What were you
                        thinking?!</strong></p>
                    <p>A: I was thinking I wanted a brown-ish noise generator and this was what I came up with that
                        worked the way I wanted it to. Looking forward to seeing your rewrite when it's finished!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Q: Did you consider $POPULAR_JS_FRAMEWORK for this project?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: Yes, but is it really necessary?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Q: Is there an app version I can download?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: Yes, but I didn't write any of them. Good luck.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Q: How do I get my question on this list?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: Pretty meta! Consider it added.</p>
