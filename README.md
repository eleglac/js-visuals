# js-visuals
A collection of interesting-looking applets in pure JS, CSS, and HTML.

## The Visuals

Currently this project contains four visualizers:

- Langton's Ant
- Truchet tiles
- Random mixing
- Color viewer

## How to use

Each visual is currently implemented as a stand-alone website.  Load the respective index.html, allow scripts (if necessary) and then click the screen.

## Next steps

- Control panels for each visualizer/interactivity
- 1-D cellular automaton
- Better control of what clicking actually does
- Instructions in each visualizer for how to use it
